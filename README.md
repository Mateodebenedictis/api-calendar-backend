# Hi everyone! 

This is one of the first apps that i made in React. it´s a community calendar app. The idea was to apply everything that i´ve learned in one simple but cool app like this one.

I encourage everyone that sees this to try it, the app is deployed in heroku and you can take a look visiting the following link:
